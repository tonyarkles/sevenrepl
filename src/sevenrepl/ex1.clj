;; Part 1: Multiply all numbers in a list by 3 - just do it in the repl

;; Part 2: Take a list of numbers and only keep the even ones - just do it in the repl

;; Part 3: FizzBuzz
;; Rules for fizz-buzz-evalute:
;; - if a number is divisible by 15, output "FizzBuzz"
;; - if a number is divisible by 3, output "Fizz"
;; - if a number is divisible by 5, output "Buzz"
;; - otherwise, output the number
;;
;; Rules for fizz-buzz:
;; Take a number N and apply fizz-buzz-evaluate to every i = 1...N (inclusive)
;; e.g. (fizz-buzz 5) => (1 2 "Fizz" 4 "Buzz")
